Research Utilities

This repository is a collection of utility scripts and (small) programs that are used to aid in the research process.
Notable examples are:

1. pubmedAbsExtrac.py
   - Utility to download abstracts from pubmed database. This can be run through a weekly cron job. The file can also be sent through e-mail via mutt
